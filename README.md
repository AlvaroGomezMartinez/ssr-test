# A-B SSR Plot Using Zsh + gnuplot
This is a test of how one can create line graphs using Zsh and the gnuplot cli application.
## Requirement
1. [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/)
```zsh
brew install gnuplot
``` 
## Notes
While this looks promising, it is not user friendly. It works well for A-B plots, but once you start introducing additional phases the complexity increases. It is do-able, however, you need to invest a good amount of time to get a shell working.
